# Data Insights Dashboard

A comprehensive data visualization dashboard showcasing daily sample collection statistics and environmental study insights. This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline from mobile data collection to web-based analytics visualization.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This dashboard was originally developed to display real-time insights from an environmental study conducted in Karachi, Pakistan, focusing on sewage collection and water quality monitoring. Due to organizational data privacy policies, this repository contains a demonstration version with anonymized sample data.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

The project implements a full-stack data pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: Mobile application built with Flutter for field data collection
2. **Data Storage**: NoSQL database using Firebase for real-time data synchronization
3. **Data Processing**: Automated triggers to transfer and process data into MySQL database
4. **Visualization**: Web dashboard using Highcharts for interactive data visualization
5. **Backend Framework**: CodeIgniter PHP framework for API and dashboard management


## 📊 Features
